# DRUNK-DRIVER
Python game for real ones.

The initial idea of our team was to modify the code of Google’s existing game, “T-Rex Game”, by adding new obstacles, images, and especially music, all of which were created by us.
In our project entitled “Drunk Driver”, we replaced the original dinosaur with an emergency police vehicle.

The main scenario of the game revolves around a robber who steals a police patrol car and attempts to escape while avoiding obstacles on the road. The obstacles are divided into three categories: a traffic light with a red signal, a crash-prevention barrier, and the front of a police station. At the same time, coins appear on the road, which the player collects and adds to their in-game wallet.

Additionally, an alcoholic drink (Campari) appears during gameplay, granting temporary invincibility for up to four collisions. While the driver is under the influence of the drink, any obstacles touched are converted into coins.
The objective of the game is to avoid as many obstacles as possible and collect the maximum number of coins.
